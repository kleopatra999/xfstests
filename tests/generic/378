# FS QA Test 378
#
# Simple permission check on hard links.
#
# Overlayfs had a bug that hardlinks don't share inode, if chmod/chown/etc.
# is performed on one of the links then the inode belonging to the other
# one won't be updated. The following patch fixed this issue
#
# 51f7e52 ovl: share inode for hard link
