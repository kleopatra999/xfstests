# FS QA Test 086
#
# This test excercises the problem with unwritten and delayed extents
# in ext4 extent status tree where we might in some cases lose a block
# worth of data. Even though this was a ext4 specific problem the
# reproducer can be easily tun on any file system so let's do that just
# in case.
#
# This tests excercises the problem fixed in kernel with commit
# "ext4: Fix data corruption caused by unwritten and delayed extents"
